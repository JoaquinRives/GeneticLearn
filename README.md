# GeneticLearn
The most common genetic algorithms implemented in a user friendly and intuitive manner.


Description: 
  GeneticML implements the most common genetic algorithms in a intuitive manner by using
  direct analogies with the biological processes of genetic selection in which GA is inspired.
  GeneticML offer a scikit-learn compatible API for model optimization that can be used for hyperparameter
  selection as well as feature selection. The ethos of this package is to provide easy straight-fordward implementation
  yet powerful that everyone can understand and apply regardless of the level of experience in genetic algorithms.

  The package is organized so that the pipeline always follows the creation of 5 elements:

    Genes --> Chromosomes --> Individual --> Population  --> Environment

   GA algorithms & methods included:
    - TODO
    - ...
